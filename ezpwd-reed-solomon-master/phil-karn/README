DESCRIPTION

    This package implements a general purpose Reed-Solomon encoding and
decoding facility. See the fec/rs.3 man page for details.

    The command "make test" runs a battery of encode/decode tests using a
variety of RS codes using random data and random errors. Each test
should pass with an "OK"; if any fail, please let me know so I can
track down the problem.


    This directory contains a modified version of:

        http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/fec-3.0.1.tar.bz2 

by Perry Kundert (perry@hardconsulting.com).

    o Added some additional test cases
    o Build only a selected subset of functionality (Reed-Solomon only)
    o Handle some other architectures.
    o Allow changing the padding specified in a prior call to init_rs_*().

    None of Phil's actual code has been changed; a simplified cross-platform
build procedure has been implemented, and a couple of deprecated functions have
been re-introduced.  The results are packaged into librs.a, and are available
by including <rs.h>, as required.
