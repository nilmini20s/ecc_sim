Ezpwd Reed-Solomon is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3
and is also available under alternative Commercial licenses negotiated directly
with Hard Consulting Corporation. If you obtained Ezpwd Reed-Solomon under the
GPL, then the GPL applies to all Ezpwd Reed-Solomon modules used on your system
as well, except as defined below. The GPL (version 3) is included in this source
tree in the file COPYING.

The c++/ezpwd/rs file is redistributed under the terms of the LGPL, regardless
of the overall licensing terms; see the file for more details, or visit:

Hard Consulting Corporation holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the Ezpwd Reed-Solomon package, and therefore can grant, at its
sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to
create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at
runtime the portions of Ezpwd Reed-Solomon which fall under the umbrella of our
copyright/license, or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although
if you've written a module for Ezpwd Reed-Solomon we would strongly encourage
you to make the same exception that we do).

In addition, Ezpwd Reed-Solomon implements many tools and APIs using its
Reed-Solomon implementation.  It is our belief that applications using these
tools and APIs do not have to be licensed under the GPL or a compatible license,
as we believe that the use of these tools and APIs do not create a 'derivative
work' as referred to in the GPL.  However, should any court or other judiciary
body find that these tools and APIs do fall under the terms of the GPL, then we
hereby grant you a license to use these protocols in combination with Ezpwd
Reed-Solomon in external applications licensed under any license you wish.
